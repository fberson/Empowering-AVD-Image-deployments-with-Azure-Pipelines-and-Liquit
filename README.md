#Session Abstract:
You can never learn enough about AVD. So as a follow-up to the AVD TechFest on November 18, we have one more session in store for you. A session by an independent AVD expert. 
We will start with a quick introduction by Liquitâ€™s own Nico Zieck, then he hands-over to AVD Expert Freek Berson who demonstrates what he has accomplished with the Liquit platform. He will showcase an Azure Pipeline Deployment that fully automates the AVD Image creation process and deployment of AVD Hosts, using the Liquit Setup Store. 
Join this demo-heavy session and learn how to leverage Yaml, Bicep Templates and Liquit to achieve this goal.
